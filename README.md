## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo
    ```

3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
    ```

4. Install any dependencies (if required):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Notes

- `.gitignore` is used to avoid tracking unnecessary files such as `.idea/`, `.venv/`, and backup files (`*.py~`).
- Make sure to commit only the source code and essential configuration files.
